# Pixelvar
Pixelvar is a MCreator mod dependecy that gives MCreator modificiation creator variable tools to make more advanced systems while they are shared between other mods.
This tool is an expansion of the other mod I had made MMP UUID which focused mainly on just IDs for players, Pixelvar does the same thing and more such as makes wind speed, 
wind direction and much, much more!
